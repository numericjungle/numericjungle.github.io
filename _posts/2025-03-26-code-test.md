## Introduction to Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, meaning the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
<!--excerpt-->

The main idea behind DP is to solve each subproblem once and store its result, avoiding the need for redundant computations. This approach is typically implemented using either:

- **Top-Down Approach (Memoization):** Recursively solving subproblems and storing their results.

- **Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation):** Iteratively solving subproblems starting from the simplest cases and combining them to solve larger subproblems.

DP is widely used in various domains such as operations research, bioinformatics, and economics, addressing problems like sequence alignment, resource allocation, and decision-making processes.

## Selected LeetCode Hard Problem: Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

One exemplary problem that utilizes dynamic programming is the [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/).

### Problem Description

Given an `m x n` integer matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix.

From each cell, you can move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

### Example

**Input:**


```
matrix = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
```


**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The longest increasing path is `[1, 2, 6, 9]`.

### Hints and Key Observations

1. **Graph Representation:** Think of the matrix as a directed graph where each cell is a node, and there is a directed edge from one node to another if you can move from the first to the second and the value in the second is greater than in the first.

2. **Topological Ordering:** The problem can be approached by processing nodes in topological order, ensuring that when processing a node, all nodes leading into it have been processed.

3. **Memoization:** Since there are overlapping subproblems (the longest path from a cell depends on the longest paths from its neighbors), use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

### Plan of Attack

1. **Initialize a Memoization Table:** Create a 2D array `memo` where `memo[i][j]` will store the length of the longest increasing path starting from cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Define a recursive function that computes the longest increasing path starting from a given cell using DFS.

3. **Iterate Through Each Cell:** For each cell in the matrix, use the DFS function to compute the longest increasing path starting from that cell, utilizing the memoization table to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Keep Track of the Maximum Path Length:** Update the maximum path length encountered during the iterations.

### Detailed Solution with Inline Comments


```python
def longestIncreasingPath(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0

    # Dimensions of the matrix
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    # Memoization table to store results of subproblems
    memo = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Directions for moving: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    def dfs(i, j):
        # If the result is already computed, return it
        if memo[i][j] != -1:
            return memo[i][j]

        # Initialize the maximum length to 1 (the cell itself)
        max_length = 1

        # Explore all four directions
        for di, dj in directions:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            # Check if the new position is within bounds and is an increasing step
            if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and matrix[ni][nj] > matrix[i][j]:
                # Recursively find the length from the neighboring cell
                length = 1 + dfs(ni, nj)
                # Update the maximum length
                max_length = max(max_length, length)

        # Store the result in the memoization table
        memo[i][j] = max_length
        return max_length

    # Initialize the result
    result = 0
    # Compute the longest increasing path starting from each cell
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            result = max(result, dfs(i, j))

    return result
```


### Explanation

- **Initialization:** We first check if the matrix is empty. Then, we initialize the dimensions `m` and `n`, and create a memoization table `memo` initialized to `-1`, indicating uncomputed states.

- **DFS Function:** The `dfs` function computes the longest increasing path starting from cell `(i, j)`. It first checks if the result is already computed. If not, it initializes `max_length` to 1 (considering the cell itself) and explores all four possible directions. For each valid move to a cell with a greater value, it recursively computes the path length and updates `max_length`. The computed result is then stored in `memo[i][j]`.

- **Iterate Through Each Cell:** We iterate through each cell in the matrix, invoking the `dfs` function to ensure all paths are considered, and update the overall maximum path length.
