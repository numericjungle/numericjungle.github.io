Our Wedding
(April 26, 2015)

We’ve come from afar
To meet one another –
Strange that we are both from Taipei,
And it was God-ordained that we should meet here at Duke!

And, fitting honor upon honor,
We are being married at Duke Chapel
Which is not only beautiful in its own right,
But it will be filled with joyful Choir singers
Who have meant so much to us

Has not God poured out blessing upon blessing upon us –
We came as strangers from a foreign land,
Were welcomed by so many folk,
Were given the opportunity to pursue our career goals,
And were destined to find each other

O, yes, and have we not been drawn closer to God
By all of the above,
And this matters the most,
And our being drawn closer to each other is a close second!

And so we thank God
For all,
Yes, for all –
O joy, O Freude!!!
