This is an application of [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge, ran on GPU (GTX-980).

Second Baroque painting is Peter Paul Rubens's [Adoration of the Magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoration_of_the_Magi_(Rubens)).

Isn't it fun? Multiple implementaions include [torch](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style), [tensorflow](https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style) can be found on github. Enjoy it!
