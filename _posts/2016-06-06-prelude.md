This blog is the forth website I built in recent few years. I appreciate many people in open source communities, stackoverflow and Github. I've been benefited greatly from projects like Jekyll and Q&As with these awesome people. This blog aims to share my thoughts on (but not limited to) technology and provide a platform for discussions.
