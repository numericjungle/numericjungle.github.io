**Advancements in Distilling Multimodal Models to Smaller Architectures**

The field of multimodal learning has witnessed significant progress in distilling large-scale models into smaller, more efficient architectures without compromising performance. This process, known as knowledge distillation, involves transferring knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model.

**Traditional State-of-the-Art Methods:**

Historically, knowledge distillation focused on aligning the output logits of teacher and student models. This approach aimed to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their predictive distributions. However, such methods often overlooked the rich internal representations and cross-modal interactions present in multimodal models.
