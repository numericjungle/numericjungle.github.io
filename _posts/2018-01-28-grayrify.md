Inspiried by the New York Times [Is the Answer to Phone Addiction a Worse Phone?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/grayscale-phone.html), I wrote a [chrome extension](https://github.com/seanschang/Grayrify) to turn some of my favorite websites into grayscale:

Looks promising! 

The installation is easy - just clone or download the github repository, then drag the "src" folder into chrome://extensions. Enjoy new life without internet addiction (hopefully)!
