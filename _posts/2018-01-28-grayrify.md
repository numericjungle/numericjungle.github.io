Inspiried by the New York Times "[Is the Answer to Phone Addiction a Worse Phone?](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/technology/grayscale-phone.html)", I wrote a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grayrify/ohkgcfmojbociedoljnnbopllifkfoim) ([source code](https://github.com/seanschang/Grayrify)) to turn some of my favorite websites into grayscale:

Looks promising! Enjoy new life without internet addiction!

P.S. To install the source code, just clone the github repo then drag the "src" folder into chrome://extensions.
