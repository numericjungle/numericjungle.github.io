> Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.

> So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.

> The most important thing in life is to earn how to give out love, and to let it come in.

<!--excerpt-->
> If you don't have the support and love and caring and concern that you get from a family, you don't have much at all. Love is so supremely important.

> Our culture doesn't encourage you to think about such things until you're about to die. We're so wrapped up with egotistical things... We're involved in trillions of little acts just to keep going. So we don't get into the habbit of standing back and looking at our lives and saying, Is this all? Is this all I want? Is something missing?

> Do what the Buddhists do. Every day, have a little bird on your shoulder that asks, 'Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?'

> Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others. You can’t get
stuck on the regrets of what should have happened. That doesn’t help you when you get
to where I am.
