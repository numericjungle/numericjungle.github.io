* A book about Google culture, management, and the authors' success stories.

* Find people with passion
  - What are trends you missed/ predicted correctly in the 2000s?
  - What's the biggest failure in your career?
  - How do you pitch your work to your CEO?
  - Page asked "Tell me something interesting I don't know" when interviewing Jonathan. 

* Hiring culture
  - A committee vote to decide who to hire - mimic from the academic
  - A false negative is better than a false positive.
  - Huge Bonus for people do great works
 
* Don't do evil
  - When they found Google was attacked by Chinese hackers, and many dissidents' Gmail accounts were almost being hacked; after careful investigations, a committee decided to move their business out from China in order to keep servers safe.

* Meeting
  - Every meeting must have an organizer, make sure participants understand the goals
  - Participants should not do their personal items during the meeting
  - Data-driven decisions: presenters prepare up-to-date data, charts, numbers to support their claims
  - Within 2 days after the meeting, the organizer should share a summary report to all participants
  - For those who just came back from business trip or vacation, give a few minutes trip highlight first, it's usually fun and inspiring. One colleague actually chatted with several cell phone dealers and heard their feedback about Android when it was just launched.  

* Email
  - Only send to relevant people, not every email goes to group alias
  - First come, last read - older requests may be resolved already

* Culture
  - Prove with data
  - Quick iterations, create a feedback loop to fast prototyping, rollout, get feedback and improve.
  - Openness and Transparency 
    - Google shares as more as possible both inside and outside the company
    - Every Google employee can submit questions anonymously to CEO, CEO will answer popular questions weekly.
  - Encourage competitions
    - A strong competitor like Bing is favored than no competitor in the market
    - Make users easy to pack their data and leave Google services, therefore, Google needs to work harder to keep them
