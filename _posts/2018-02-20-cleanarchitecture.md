Notes from Robert C. Martin - Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design. 

> The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.

Two perspectives of software:

  1. behaviors (functions, features)
  2. architecture - software must be easy to change, however, when the scope grows, changes become harder and harder.


* Software architects are more focused on the structure of the system than on its features and functions”
* Architects create an architecture that allows those features and functions to be easily developed, modified and extended.
* If architecture comes last, then the system will become ever more costly to develop, and eventually change will become practically impossible for part or all of the system.

Paradigms: overview

  * structured programming by Dijkstra - goto, if then else, do while until.
  * object-oriented patterns - class, constructor, method


> Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.


  * functional programming - lambda calculus, no assignment 


> Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment.
