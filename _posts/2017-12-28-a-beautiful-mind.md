* His Princeton Math PhD thesis on non-cooperative game theory (Nash equilibrium) only has 29 pages and won him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics decades later. He met John von Neumann @Princeton who might inspire Nash on his thesis, but Nash was sceptical about von Neumann may take his ideas and stopped talking with von Neumann.

<!--excerpt-->

* An arrogant young man in the graduate school, he once fought with Serge Lang (later an algebraist in UChicago) by suggesting Lang to date with his advisor's daughter.

* Being a professor in a top math department was Nash's goal after PhD. His game theory was somewhat disappointed to his undergraduate advisor (who wrote "He is a mathematical genius" in Nash's recommendation letter) and other mathematicians since they believe Nash can contribute more in pure math with his talent. At this time, Nash shifted his interests to geometry, differential equations.

* In NYU Courant's institute working with Nirenberg and other analysts, he started working on partial differential equations (PDE), with almost no background in PDE, Nash was able to rediscover many theorems and inequalities with his own proofs. Nash rarely reads books or papers, he tackled hard problems directly and discussed his findings and questions with other mathematicians. 

* Ill-temperated and arrogant Nash did not have good relationships with many professors at MIT. A professor once challenged "If you are such a genius, why don't you solve the embedding theorem?" (roughly speaking every Riemannian manifold can be embedded in a higher dimensional Euclidean space with distances preserved). Nash replied with anger "I can prove it next week!". Then it took Nash one year to prove the theorem (now Nash's embedding theorem) and won him more respects.

* At some point, Nash claimed he proved the Riemann hypothesis, however, most of his attempts were proposed before and turned out to be false. Around the same time, he started to have symptoms of schizophrenia.

* Paranoid schizophrenia and inappropriate treatments destroyed Nash in his 30s-60s. Nash suffered greatly in the psychiatric hospitals and insulin shock therapy - a popular risky treatment in the 1960s. He escaped from the hospital several times, he went to France, Eastern Europe and tried to abandon his US citizenship unsuccessfully. While he was away from the math community, his classmate John Milnor and Eugenio Calabi already became famous mathematicians.  

* Alicia, Nash's wife, took great effort to support of Nash and their child, John Charles Nash (who is also schizophrenic). After graduated from MIT, she gave up going to grad school, many good career opportunities; she commuted 4 hours a day in order to take care of Nash. When their child just born, she left their child to her mom and traveled to France since Nash was going there relentlessly. She is definitely a hero behind Nash(s) and mental health care awareness.
